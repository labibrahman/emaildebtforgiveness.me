## How does it work?
> If there’s an email response you’ve wanted to send but been too anxious to send, you can send it on **April 30th**, without any apologies or explanations for all the time that has lapsed.
> It doesn’t matter how long it’s been. Just include a link to this explainer, the one you’re reading right now, so that your recipient knows what’s going on.
> Together, we can all make our inboxes less stressful.
